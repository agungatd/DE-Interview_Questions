## **Beginner (Junior)**

### 1. **What is Apache Kafka?**  

+ **Answer:** Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform designed for high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and real-time data processing. It is used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.  
+ **Explanation:** Kafka allows producers to publish messages to topics, which are then consumed by subscribers. It is widely used for log aggregation, event sourcing, and stream processing.

### 2. **What are the key components of Kafka?** 

**Answer:** The key components are:  
    - **Producer:** Publishes messages to Kafka topics.  
    - **Consumer:** Subscribes to topics and processes messages.  
    - **Broker:** A Kafka server that stores and manages topics.  
    - **Topic:** A category or feed name for messages.  
    - **Partition:** Topics are divided into partitions for scalability.

### 3. **What is a partition in Kafka?**  

+ **Answer:** A partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records within a topic. Each partition is replicated across brokers for fault tolerance.  
+ **Explanation:** Partitions enable parallel processing and scalability by distributing data across multiple brokers.

### 4. **What is the role of ZooKeeper in Kafka?**  

+ **Answer:** ZooKeeper manages and coordinates Kafka brokers, handles leader election, and maintains cluster metadata.  
+ **Explanation:** Kafka 2.8+ introduced KRaft mode, allowing Kafka to operate without ZooKeeper, simplifying the architecture.

### 5. **How does Kafka ensure fault tolerance?**  

+ **Answer:** Kafka replicates partitions across multiple brokers. If a broker fails, a replica (follower) takes over as the leader.  
+ **Explanation:** Replication ensures data durability and high availability.

### 6. **What is a consumer group in Kafka?**  

+ **Answer:** A consumer group is a set of consumers that jointly consume messages from one or more topics. Each consumer in the group reads from exclusive partitions.  
+ **Explanation:** Consumer groups enable load balancing and parallel processing.

### 7. **What is the purpose of offsets in Kafka?**  

+ **Answer:** Offsets are unique identifiers for records within a partition. They allow consumers to track their position in the log.  
+ **Explanation:** Offsets ensure that consumers can resume processing from where they left off, even after failures.

### 8. **How does Kafka handle message ordering?**  

+ **Answer:** Kafka guarantees message order within a partition but not across partitions.  
+ **Explanation:** Producers can use keys to ensure related messages go to the same partition, preserving order.

### 9. **What is log compaction in Kafka?**  

+ **Answer:** Log compaction ensures that the log retains the latest value for each key, removing older duplicates.  
+ **Explanation:** This is useful for maintaining the latest state of data, such as in configuration management.

### 10. **How do you start a Kafka server?**  
+ **Answer:** Start ZooKeeper first, then the Kafka broker:  
    ```bash  
    bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties  
    bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties  
    ```  
+ **Explanation:** Kafka relies on ZooKeeper for cluster coordination.

## **Intermediate (Senior)**

### 1. **How does Kafka achieve high throughput and low latency?**  

+ **Answer:** Kafka uses batching, zero-copy I/O, and partitioning to achieve high throughput. Low latency is achieved through efficient disk writes and consumer offsets.  
+ **Explanation:** Kafka’s design minimizes disk seeks and leverages sequential I/O for performance.

### 2. **What is the role of ISR (In-Sync Replicas) in Kafka?**  

+ **Answer:** ISR refers to replicas that are fully synchronized with the leader. They ensure data durability and high availability.  
+ **Explanation:** If a leader fails, a replica from the ISR is elected as the new leader.

### 3. **How do you ensure exactly-once semantics in Kafka?**  

+ **Answer:** Use idempotent producers and Kafka’s transactional API. Configure `enable.idempotence=true` and manage transactions with `beginTransaction()`, `commitTransaction()`, and `abortTransaction()`.  
+ **Explanation:** This prevents duplicate messages and ensures atomicity across partitions.

### 4. **What is the difference between Kafka Streams and Apache Flink?**  

+ **Answer:** Kafka Streams is a client library for stream processing within Kafka, while Flink is a distributed processing engine for complex stream processing.  
+ **Explanation:** Kafka Streams is simpler to deploy, while Flink offers lower latency for complex operations.

### 5. **How do you monitor Kafka performance?**  

+ **Answer:** Use tools like Kafka’s JMX metrics, Prometheus, Grafana, and Consumer Lag monitoring.  
+ **Explanation:** Monitoring helps identify bottlenecks, under-replicated partitions, and consumer lag.

### 6. **What is the purpose of Kafka Connect?**  

+ **Answer:** Kafka Connect is a tool for scalable and reliable data integration between Kafka and external systems like databases.  
+ **Explanation:** It simplifies the creation of connectors for data import/export.
### 7. **How do you handle backpressure in Kafka?**  

+ **Answer:** Adjust consumer fetch parameters, increase consumer parallelism, and optimize batch sizes.  
+ **Explanation:** Backpressure occurs when consumers cannot keep up with producers, leading to increased latency.

### 8. **What is the significance of the `acks` parameter in Kafka producers?**  

+ **Answer:** The `acks` parameter controls the number of acknowledgments required for a message to be considered committed. Options are `0`, `1`, and `all`.  
+ **Explanation:** `acks=all` ensures the highest durability but increases latency.

### 9. **How do you secure a Kafka cluster?**  

+ **Answer:** Use SSL/TLS for encryption, SASL for authentication, and ACLs for authorization.  
+ **Explanation:** Security measures protect data in transit and at rest.

### 10. **What is Kafka MirrorMaker?**  

+ **Answer:** MirrorMaker is a tool for replicating data between Kafka clusters, often used for geo-replication and disaster recovery.  
+ **Explanation:** It ensures data redundancy and availability across data centers.
